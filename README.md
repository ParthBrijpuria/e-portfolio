First day of iitr-

  It was good, I loved the beautiful campus(emphasize), altho hated the first day campus registration incident where we had to wait in so much heat in the afternoon 

Altho overall I liked the experience, when I got the alloted room, it was the corner bed which I wished for

I was scared however that what will be happening in the next initial days 

Overall experience till now here -

There have been many ups and downs, I have made some really good new friends, not just of my branch but of other branch as well

Also we studied till late nights before the mid term exam, I have scored well in most of them(above average)

Night life is really good here

We can go to night canteens 

Started playing table tennis here and now I am addicted to it(image attached)

the freshers party was really good, it was my first time experience(really enjoyed)(image attached)-

Danced for the first time in my life(image attached)

also we went for mussoorrie trip(it was an amazing experience)(img attached)
